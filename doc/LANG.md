## Language

This is a high level summary of the language system.



## Problem Statement

The orgs and users deal with the problem of languages and multimedia not being in their native language.

Typically third parties or software are needed to get around this problem. You can't work concurrently, and you are tied to the physical location.

## Solutions


All Documents are indexed, so that all the team can concurently work from anywhere.

Documents are transcribed into the Teams lanuguage, and also other actors' languages.


## Features

### Graphcial User Interface

The software runs in all human languges.


### OCR

Documents are scanned into the sytem. 

The system then translates them to English and the other team members' languages.

Then it indexes the documents.

Provides facets to be applied, to allow teams to do facet search.

Why ?

- Teams often have projects that have actors involved that do not speak the native language.

- Documents are key.

### Audio

Same as OCR but applied to any audio.

These are translated and also transcribed to text, so it can be indexed and then searched against as needed.

Why ?

- Part of a project can involve audio files.


### Video Conferencing

Same as OCR but for video conferencing.

In a 2 person or many person chat or video conference it translates the chat text and the audio to everyones own languages in real time.

These are displayed as subtitles for each user.

The audio is recorded and transcribed to text as a log, so that the machine translated text can also be checked quickly by a human within 5 or 10 minutes.

Why ?

- Often parties are not all speaking the same language, and you dont have a translator/friend around.

- You need to do due diligence quickly in real time. Actors can be anywhere around the world, and a fully encapsulated secure system is the best option.

- You need it to be 100% secure. Most other systems are actually not.
