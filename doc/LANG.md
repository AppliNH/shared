Problem Statement:

The orgs and users deal with the problem of languages and multimedia not being in their native language.

Typically third parties / or software are needed to get around this problem. You cant work concurrently, and you are tied to the physical location.

Solutions:


All Documents are indexex, so that all the Team can concurently work from anywhere.

Transcribe all documents into the Teams lanuguage and also other actors languages.


The following functionality is provided.

1. OCR

Documents are scanned into the sytem. 

The system then translates them to English and the other Team members languages.

Then its Indexes the documents.

Provides facets to be applied, to allow Teams to do facet search.

Why ?

- Legal teams often have projects that have actors involved that are overseas or in the same country but are immigrants and do not speak the naive language.

- These can be any actors - Extra jurisdiction cases, or even just immigrants in the same country.

- Documents ( Testimonials, contracts, wills, etc, etc )

2. Audio

Same as OCR but applied to any Audio.

These are translated and also transcribed to text, so it can be indexed and then searched against as needed.

Why ?

- Part of a case can involve audio files.


3. Video Conferencing

Same as OCR but for Video conferencing.

In a 2 person or many person chat or video conference it translates the chat text and the audio to everyones own languages in real time.

The audio is recorded and transcribed to text as a log, so that the machine translated text can also be checked quickly by a human within 5 or 10 minutes. They can be notorised or not. Up to the Team using the software.

Why ?

- Often parties are not all speaking the same language, and you dont have a notorised translator around.

- You need to do due diligence quickly in real time. Actors can be anywhere around the world, and a fully encapsulated secure system is the best option.

- You need it to be 100% secure. Most other systems are actually not.
