# Legal Domain

Many orgs need to work and collaborate on legal cases or just manage their legal documents in a secure way.

This document highlights how a legal team or any org that need to work with legal matters can use the software to accelerate their processes, and have a fully secure system where they hold all the data themselves.

## Problem

A legal team during Discovery and Deposition phase are often faced with mountains of documents and multimedia.

Various documents, audio or video may not be in the Legal Teams language. 

Managing this huge amount of documentation is very inefficient and time consumng for the Legal Team. You cant work concurrently, and you are tied to the physical location where the documents exist.

Document exchange with other legal teams slows down the process and is expensive.

You often need a secure video conference system for court as well as out of court.
