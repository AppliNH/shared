# NVDA Domain - Non Violet Direct Action

Relavent Terms and Definitions:

- [NVDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action#Nonviolent_action)

Many orgs need to work and collaborate on non violent direct action campaign planning and execution in a secure way.

This document highlights how any grassroots or activist team can use the software to accelerate their processes within a fully secure system where they hold all the data themselves.

## Problem

NVDA campaign teams are often faced with mountains of network communication streams, working group set up, planning documents, and other media during the discovery, organization, and implimentation phases of the campaign.

Many of these teams or networks reach a range of ethnically diverse members, meaning that the above mentioned planning and media may not be in team members' first or even second language. 

The information in such media and communication is often of a sensitive nature, and needs to be shared through highly secure means. Currently, such groups are using a variety of different platforms, creating disconnect and decreasing efficiency. 

## Solutions

The software allows your team to work through organization and implimentation of NVDA campaigns between the internal and external contributors quickly and securely and in any language to allow for greater inclusivity.

For your org, create a project for each campaign.

Create or scan all media and index them under that relevant campaign, so that all the team can concurently work on the campaign from anywhere.

All media and communication (including chat and video conferencing) is automatically transcribed into the users chosen language, so that collaboration can happen in real time and across language and geographical barriers.
