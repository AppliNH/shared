# Canvassing Domain

Relavent Terms and Definitions:

- [Canvassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvassing)

Many grassroots orgs involved in fighting for social, environmental, and econimic justice need to work and collaborate in small to very large teams on canvassing, planning, and execution of campaign in a secure way.

This document highlights how any such teams can use the software to accelerate their processes within a fully secure system where they hold all the data themselves.

## Problem

Grassroots orgs now do most of their organizing online, including networking, working group set up, task management, team meetings and onboarding, document creating and sharing, collection of promotional media, and of course many other important elements during the discovery, organization, and implimentation phases of their campaigns.

Many of these teams or networks reach a range of ethnically diverse members, meaning that the above mentioned doccuments, media, and communication may not be in team members' first or even second language. 

Currently, such groups are using a variety of different platforms to develop, share, and organize their campaigns, creating disconnect, app fatigue, and decreasing efficiency. 

The information in such media and communication may also be of a sensitive nature, and needs to be shared through highly secure means. 

## Solutions

The software allows your team to work through all stages of any grasstoots campaign between the internal and external contributors quickly and securely and in any language to allow for greater inclusivity and collaboration.

For your org, create a project for each campaign.

Create or scan all media (documents, audio, video) and index them under that relevant campaign, so that all the team can concurently work on the campaign from anywhere. Use the chat, video conferencing, and task management tools to boost team engagement and productivity. 

All media and communication (including chat and video conferencing) is automatically transcribed into the users chosen language, so that collaboration can happen in real time and across language and geographical barriers.
