# Education domain

Many schools and universities are using or need [Education Software.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_software)

In addition there are various sub domains of [Educational Software.md](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_educational_software)



## Problem Statement

Privacy and data ownership is highly important in this sector because of the potential for bad actors to take advantage of kids. 



## Solutions

High light points:

- Privacy: Protects kids from online stalkers. They are only connecting to thier own Rasp PI. So their are firewalled essentially.

- Multi languages

- Offline Does not need internet connection, which can be an issue in Countries with poor internet connectivity. The Rasp Pi in the school holds all tthe data, and the childrens own device ( Laptop, Tablet, etc) is always kept up to date, and so when they leave school all their homework and other data they need is on their device. They can do their homework and access everything they need without a home internet conection.

- Conferencing and Chat 

## Case Study

In Kenya is really useful because the Rasp Pi is in the school and the kids tablets / laptops automaticallyÂ sync and so when the kids go home they can work 100% off their laptop offline and see everything and do their homework.

This mean the kids never connect to a network where bad actors can reach them. The schools cross sync the data between each other and so form their own private, secure and redundant cloud. So if their Rasp Pi fails or whatever, they can boot another one and sync it from a nearby school.

We are currently working to get our system to work on Pine64 devices which are secure, high quality and inexpensive devices.
