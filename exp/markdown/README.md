# flutter markdown

We need a documenation web site / module to make it easy for users to have docs if they get stuck.

From any part of the app, a help link goes to a specifc TOC

Run from embedded assets OR assets from Server ( github or simple lang server )
- should just be a config setting and it does the rest
- Parses the asset for the tree of markdowns, so it can make the global TOC and the link to each makrdown can be then loaded.

Deeplinks. So that any part can be deepinked into, and so that other systems can use that deep link, to take a user directly to the markdown they need.
