# authy

We need a new place to run the 2FA verification stuff.

Currently we use https://www.twilio.com/authy

This is simple stuff and not hard to do in golang and their are many examples
We can also run webauthn: 
- https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn
	- has stuff missing because they want to sell licenses.
- https://github.com/fxamacker/webauthn-demo

The GUI is also easy.
